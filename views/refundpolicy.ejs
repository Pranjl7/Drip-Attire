            <!-- OVERVIEW -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800">OVERVIEW</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">This Refund Policy applies to all purchases made through Drip
                Attire. Throughout the site, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Drip Attire. By purchasing from us,
                you agree to the terms outlined below regarding returns, refunds, and exchanges.
                <br><br>
                By placing an order on our site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this
                Refund Policy. These conditions apply to all customers of the Drip Attire store, including without
                limitation users who are browsers, purchasers, or contributors of content.
                <br><br>
                We reserve the right to update or modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on
                this page, and it is your responsibility to review this policy periodically.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-1 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 1 - RETURNS</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">We accept returns within 7 days of delivery for eligible
                products. To complete your return, your item must be unused, unwashed, and in the same condition that
                you received it. The original packaging, tags, and labels must be intact, and you must provide a receipt
                or proof of purchase. Some items cannot be returned, including sale items, accessories, innerwear, and
                gift cards. If an item does not meet the required conditions, we reserve the right to deny the return.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-2 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 2 - EXCHANGES</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">If you receive a defective or damaged item, or if the size
                does not fit, we will offer an exchange depending on product availability. To request an exchange, you
                must contact us with your order number and details of the issue, and provide images if the product is
                damaged or defective. After approval from our team, you will receive further instructions. We do not
                offer exchanges for items that have been worn, washed, or altered.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-3 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 3 - REFUNDS</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">Once your returned item is received and inspected, we will
                notify you by email regarding the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, the refund will be
                processed and credited to your original method of payment within 7 to 10 business days, depending on
                your bank's processing time. Shipping costs are non-refundable, and if you receive a refund, the cost of
                return shipping may be deducted from your total. Partial refunds may be issued for items that are not in
                their original condition, items returned without essential parts, or items returned after the 7-day
                window if accepted at our discretion.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-4 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 4 - LATE OR MISSING REFUNDS</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">If you have not received your refund, you should first check
                your bank account again. You may then need to contact your credit or debit card company, as it may take
                some time before your refund is officially posted. You should also contact your bank, because processing
                times vary. If you have completed all of these steps and still have not received your refund, you may
                contact us at our support email.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-5 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 5 - ORDER CANCELLATION</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">Orders can only be cancelled within 2 hours of placing them.
                After this period, the order moves into processing and cannot be cancelled. If a cancellation request is
                approved, the refund will be issued to your original payment method.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-6 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 6 - SALE ITEMS</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">Only regular-priced items are eligible for refunds. Sale
                items, discounted items, and promotional offers are non-refundable and cannot be returned.
            </p>
            <br>

            <!-- SECTION-7 -->
            <p class="text-[14px] font-bold text-gray-800 mt-1">SECTION 7 - SHIPPING RETURNS</p>
            <p class="text-[14px] leading-5 text-gray-800">To return a product, you must follow the instructions
                provided by our support team. Customers are responsible for their own return shipping costs unless the
                item is defective or incorrect. The time it may take for an exchanged product to reach you may vary
                depending on your location. We recommend using a trackable shipping service when sending a return, as we
                cannot guarantee that we will receive your returned package.
